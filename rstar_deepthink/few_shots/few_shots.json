  "Question: Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?\n<code>\n# Step 1: Calculate the total weight lifted with two 20-pound weights\ntotal_weight_20 = 2 * 20 * 12\n<end_of_step>\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the weight lifted per repetition with two 15-pound weights\nweight_per_rep_15 = 2 * 15\n<end_of_step>\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the number of repetitions needed to lift the same total weight with two 15-pound weights\nreps_needed = total_weight_20 / weight_per_rep_15\n<end_of_step>\n\n# Now print the final answer\nprint(reps_needed)\n<end_of_code>\n<output>16.0<end_of_output><answer>From the result, we can see that Terrell must lift the 15-pound weights \\boxed{16} times to lift the same total weight.\n<end_of_answer>",
